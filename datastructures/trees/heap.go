package trees

// A heap is a complete binary tree (that is, totally filled other than the rightmost elements on the last
// level). There are two types of heaps => min-heaps and max-heaps.
// in a min-heap, a parent node is smaller than it's children, therefore,
// in a min-heap the root node is the smallest element in the tree
